General notes:

setImage function in liveview functions seems to start some seperate thread process. viewtimer waits for this process to finish before calling timeout again. Clue to this was
was that the line setImage did not take any time but time until next update call was long.




Issues...

hamamatsu_coltrol.py cannot be imported as module if Orcaflash is not connected since camera is tried to be initialized when importing the module. 
Raises DCAMException. This exception cannot be caught outside this module since the exceptionclass cannot be initialized if the module cannot be 
initialized... DCAMException is not caught anywhere in hamamatsu_control -> unnecessary? "Try : import" is used now but requires a default Except:
which is not really good to have.  

Bugs or TODOs:

Even though parameters like Y0 and X0 show zero they can still apparently take negative values with can give error when trying to pass to camera.

Try to rearrange so that the liveview updating occurs in seperate thread so as to not "freeze" the gui at low frame rates -> big fov. See how done in 
Recording Widget when Recworker is moved to new thread. Maybe create Liveviewer class that does the update and move to own thread before starting.
