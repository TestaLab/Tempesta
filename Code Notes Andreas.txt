setImage function in liveview functions seems to start some seperate thread process. viewtimer waits for this process to finish before calling timeout again. Clue to this was
was that the line setImage did not take any time but time until next update call was long.




Issues...

hamamatsu_coltrol.py cannot be imported as module if Orcaflash is not connected since camera is tried to be initialized when importing the module. 
Raises DCAMException. This exception cannot be caught outside this module since the exceptionclass cannot be initialized if the module cannot be 
initialized... DCAMException is not caught anywhere in hamamatsu_control -> unnecessary? "Try : import" is used now but requires a default Except:
which is not really good to have.
