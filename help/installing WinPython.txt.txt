1) Always use the WinPython Control Panel to install packages, is the easiest way

2) tifffile module is not available for Python 3.4, be careful with that

3) lantz package must be downloaded from fedebarabas github, that version contains drivers used in Tormenta

4) "no module named pint or stringparser": fix - "pip install pint" and "pip install stringparser" in python console
